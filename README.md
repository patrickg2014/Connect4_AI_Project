# University of Puget Sound AI Competition

This is the first AI competition at the University of Puget Sound. In this repository are all the necessary files and instructions to get started.

## The Competition

Participants will design an AI to play a game of Connect 4 against a human opponent. Your opponent will always go first. Each AI will be judged based on their win/loss ratio and how well they respond to a series of tests that will be performed on the day of the competition.

Anyone can participate if they want to.
