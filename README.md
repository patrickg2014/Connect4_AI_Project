# University of Puget Sound AI Competition

This is the first AI competition at the University of Puget Sound. In this repository are all the necessary files and instructions to get started.

## The Competition

Participants will design an AI to play a game of Connect 4 against a human opponent. Your opponent will always go first. Each AI will be judged based on their win/loss ratio and how well they respond to a series of tests that will be performed on the day of the competition. Participants will handle competitors

## How To Participate

Participation is easy. Extend the [AI Class] provided in the repository. During the competition, the [Make Move] method will be called, and your AI should return a valid board state containing the next move. 

There is an example AI named toTheLeft.py, which you can use to see a simple example of an AI.

To test your AI, change the Game.py script to import your AI. More specific instructions are in the Game.py file. 


## Getting Started

Below are some helpful links to get started on the project.

[Download Python](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download): Installation instructions for python. If you using  mac or linux it should already be preinstalled. For this project we will be using the latest version of Python 2.


[Learn Github](http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github): Best tutorial I have found to get started using github. It doesn't cover every detail, but it teaches the basics to get up and running.

[Learn Python in 10 Minutes](http://korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/): Easiest way to learn python. Also serves as a great reference. 

[More on Python](http://learnpythonthehardway.org): Not necessary, but interesting for those who are interested in learning more about python.
